## New Features:  
### Bing Translate API  

This allows for the display and interpretation of multiple languages for the chatbot. I implemented these features by displaying the respones and interpreting the queries in both french and english as these are the official languages of Canada. As well as allowing the text of the webpage to be switched between french and english with two buttons.
